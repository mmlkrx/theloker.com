      <h2>Possible Projects</h2>
      <p>All projects in this list still need to be defined in more detail. The initial effort per project should be 2-6 weeks with 4-16 hours per week depending on the type of project and available time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="#discover" name="discover">Discover</a></h3>
          <p>Imagine a website connected to the multiverse internet. This website would let you find a version of yourself that had the same problem that you have and provide you with the contact details of the person that solved that problem for them. Of course we don't have the multiverse internet (yet), so the goal would be to have a process, which helps find a coach/expert/trainer, that helped someone with a similar background/skill level/problem composition that you have, solve their problem.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="#instamania" name="instamania">Instamania</a></h3>
          <p>A bot to organically grow engaged followers on instagram. Recently instagram has been restricting their public APIs, the goal of the bot would be to leverage the private API and completely escape detection by instagram by behaving in a natural manner (posting comments, liking, following, etc.).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="#poe" name="poe">Proof of Existence</a></h3>
          <p>A simple website that allows people to submit any document or picture and store the data's SHA on the ethereum blockchain. Because the blockchain data can't be changed one can proof that a piece of data existed at a certain point in time. Should integrate with Metamask to make submitting the transaction easy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="#ghostfacebook" name="ghostfacebook">Ghost Facebook</a></h3>
          <p>Detailed instructions on how to download all of your data off of facebook and then delete everything and only keep a ghost profile on facebook to still be able to use messenger and events.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="#fununits" name="fununits">Fun Units</a></h3>

        <li>

          <p>Media management software for film productions. Media managers can determine what behind the scenes photos and footage is permitted to be released. Then crew and actors can access released photos and share with their social media following to help market the project and build anticipation. News websites can pay for early access.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <h3><a href="#groceryalert" name="groceryalert">Grocery Alert</a></h3>
          <p>Platform that lets people purchase supermarket groceries that are about to meet their date of expiry. Home delivery at night with bike messengers (potential cooperation with Foodora/Deliveroo). Supermarkets write off (throw away) food that is about to expire or just expired. People could buy these items on the platform.</p>
        </li>
